# Clonal_NK
Analysis of human NK cells by ASAP-Seq with clonality tracking using mitochondrial mutations and CITE-Seq. Cells were either isolated ex vivo (HCMV+/-) or stimulated with different conditions in vitro (HCMV-)

Scripts are organized by modality (scRNA/ATAC) and experiment (in vitro/in vivo).

Raw and processed data is deposited at GEO: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE197037">GSE197037</a>
